# Notes for Tomorrow Morning - Oct 28, 2025

## What We Tried Tonight

Built a **simple GUI** to do both video + BWF simultaneously.

**Status:** Not working yet (didn't get to test/debug).

---

## What Definitely Works ‚úÖ

1. **Command-line transcoding** - FFmpeg with hardware accel (7-8x speed)
2. **BWF tools** - Your validated scripts in `bwf-tools/` directory
3. **The core logic** - All the actual processing works perfectly

---

## What to Try Tomorrow

### Option 1: Use Working Saved Versions
- `Transcoder_pre_Frame_Wrap_20251027_143849/` 
- `Transcoder_GUI_Working_20251028_002819/`

Pick one, add hardware acceleration flags, done.

### Option 2: Debug Tonight's Simple GUI
- Check what didn't work
- New files created: `src/components/SimpleTranscoder.tsx`
- New commands added to Rust backend

### Option 3: Just Use Scripts (Works Now!)
```bash
./transcode_fast_hw_accel.sh input.MXF
# Plus your BWF tools
```

## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disk 98% full** (11GB free)  
Clean up before doing more work!

---

## Quick Working Example

This definitely works right now:
```bash
# Hardware accelerated video:
ffmpeg -hwaccel videotoolbox -i input.MXF \
  -c:v dnxhd -profile:v dnxhr_lb -pix_fmt yuv422p \
  -c:a pcm_s24le -ar 48000 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a \
  -threads 0 output.mov

# BWF audio:
python3 bwf-tools/insert_bext_timecode.py \
  input.MXF output.wav \
  --time-ref CALCULATED_VALUE \
  --sample-rate 48000 \
  --frame-rate 23.976
```

Sleep well! üò¥
